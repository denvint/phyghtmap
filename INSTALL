The installation requires a working python setuptools installation; 
setuptools is included in python >=2.5, otherwise say XXX  The
program itself should run with python >= 2.6.  The setup will use ez_setup which
is included within this distribution.

Some additional requirements have to be installed on your system in order to run
phyghtmap:

* python-pkg-resources (on Debian-like systems, say apt-get install
  python-pkg-resources)
* python-matplotlib (on Debian-like systems, say apt-get install
	python-matplotlib)
* python-beatifulsoup (on Debian-like systems, say apt-get install
	python-beatifulsoup)
* python-numpy (on Debian-like systems, say apt-get install python-numpy)

To install phyghtmap, finally say

sudo python setup.py install

which will install the stuff on your system.
