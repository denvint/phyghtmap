.SH NAME
\fBphyghtmap\fR
- NASA SRTM -> OSM xml translator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B phyghtmap
[\fIoptions\fR] [\fI<hgt file>\fR] [\fI<hgt files>\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
phyghtmap generates contour lines from NASA SRTM data.
It takes at least an area definition as input.  It then looks for a
cache directory (./hgt/) and the needed SRTM files.  If no cache
directory is found, it will be created.  It then downloads all the
needed NASA SRTM data files automatically if they are not cached yet.
There is also the possibility of masking the NASA SRTM data with data
from www.viewfinderpanoramas.org which fills voids and other data
lacking in the NASA data set.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
show this help message and exit
.TP
\fB\-a\fR LEFT:BOTTOM:RIGHT:TOP, \fB\-\-area\fR=\fILEFT\fR:BOTTOM:RIGHT:TOP
choses the area to generate osm SRTM data for by
bounding box. If necessary, files are downloaded from
the NASA server
(http://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/SRTM[1|3]).
Specify as <left>:<bottom>:<right>:<top> in degrees of
latitude and longitude, respectively. Latitudes south
of the equator and longitudes west of Greenwich may be
given as negative decimal numbers. If this option is
given, specified hgt files will be omitted.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR STEP, \fB\-\-step\fR=\fISTEP\fR
specify contour line step size in meters. The default
value is 20.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR PREFIX, \fB\-\-output\-prefix\fR=\fIPREFIX\fR
specify a prefix for the filenames of the output osm
file(s).
.TP
\fB\-p\fR PLOTNAME, \fB\-\-plot\fR=\fIPLOTNAME\fR
specify the path to write longitude/latitude/elevation
data to instead of generating contour osm.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR ELEVATION_MAJOR,ELEVATION_MEDIUM, \fB\-\-line\-cat\fR=\fIELEVATION_MAJOR\fR,ELEVATION_MEDIUM
specify a string of two comma seperated integers for
major and medium elevation categories, e. g. '200,100'
which is the default. This is needed for fancy
rendering.
.TP
\fB\-j\fR NJOBS, \fB\-\-jobs\fR=\fINJOBS\fR
number of jobs to be run in parallel (POSIX only)
.TP
\fB\-\-version\-tag\fR=\fIVERSIONTAG\fR
pass an integer as VERSIONTAG for osm elements to
output osm.  This is needed to display the generated
contour data with newer JOSM versions.  The default
value is None.
.TP
\fB\-\-start\-node\-id\fR=\fISTARTID\fR
specify an integer as id of the first written node in
the output OSM xml.  It defaults to 10000000 but some
OSM xml mergers are running into trouble when
encountering non unique ids.  In this case and for the
moment, it is safe to say 10000000000 (ten billion)
then.
.TP
\fB\-\-srtm\fR=\fISRTM\-RESOLUTION\fR
use SRTM resolution of SRTM\-RESOLUTION arc seconds.
Note that the finer 1 arc second grid is only
available in the USA.  Possible values are 1 and 3,
the default value is 3.
.TP
\fB\-\-viewfinder\-mask\fR=\fIVIEWFINDER\-RESOLUTION\fR
if specified, NASA SRTM data are masked with data from
www.viewfinderpanoramas.org.  Possible values are 1
and 3 (for explanation, see the \fB\-\-srtm\fR option).
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print version and exit.
.SH "USAGE EXAMPLES"
Here are some usage examples
.TP
phyghtmap -a 8.59:49.34:8.78:49.45
generate openstreetmap xml for the area around Heidelberg, Germany
.TP
phyghtmap -a 8.59:49.34:8.78:49.45 -o heidelberg
same as above but save data to heidelberg_*.osm files instead of automatically
generated filenames
.TP
phyghtmap -a -25:62:-12:68 -o iceland
This will not work since no SRTM data is available north of 60 degrees of
north.
.TP
phyghtmap -a -25:62:-12:68 -o iceland --viewfinder-mask=3
Yes, this works.  There is data available for that area at
www.viewfinderpanoramas.org.
.TP
phyghtmap -a -25:62:-12:68 -o iceland --viewfinder-mask=3 -j 16
Same as above but use 16 parallel processes for the contour line calculation.
.TP
phyghtmap -a -25:62:-12:68 -o iceland -s 10 -c 100,50
Say this, if you want contour lines for Iceland with a step size of ten meters
and major contour lines every 100 meters and medium contour lines every 50
meters.
.TP
phyghtmap -a 6:44:9:47 -o high_alps --viewfinder-mask=1
With this, you get wonderful contour line .osm with a resolution of 1 arc
second where data is available at www.viewfinderpanoramas.org and NASA SRTM 3
arc second data elsewhere.
.TP
phyghtmap -s 5 some_filename.hgt
Make contour line .osm with steps of 5 meters from file some_filename.hgt.
Note that no area was specified here.  You can use phyghtmap like this with .hgt
files from sources other than NASA SRTM or www.viewfinderpanoramas.org.
.TP
phyghtmap -p example_plotname.xyz -a 8.9:49.0:9.0:49.1
Do not generate contour line OSM xml but write a file 'example_plotname.xyz'
with lines containing space seperated values of longitude, latitude and
elevation for each point stored in the corresponding .hgt file within the
specified area.
